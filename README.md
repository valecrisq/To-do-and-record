### About the Project

In this project you can insert 2 different values (name and description) in two different input.
The app will save your 'todo' and, if the recording is enabled, you will find every action in the history on the right.
You can also stop the recording, play what was recorded and clear the history.

To complete this project I used React (Hooks), Redux and Bootstrap for CSS.
